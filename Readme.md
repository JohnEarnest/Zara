This game is a simplified reimplementation of a shareware title called _Zarathustra_ whose [website](http://members.aol.com/deadmanx/zarathustra.html) appears to be long gone. I stumbled across the game in an old shareware CD and I was surprised at its depth and elegance. If you are the original creator of _Zarathustra_, or you have any up-to-date contact information for them, please drop me a line. You can try Zara and learn the rules [here](http://johnearnest.github.io/Zara/).
