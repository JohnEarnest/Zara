		<p>
			This game is a simplified reimplementation of a shareware title called <i>Zarathustra</i>.
			Find out more on <a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Zara">GitHub</a>.

		<p>
			Players take turns dragging tiles onto the board.
			The edges of a tile are shields, spears or blank.
			Tiles may be rotated by clicking on them.
			When a player runs out of tiles or empty spaces on the board,
			the game ends and players earn points for each blank edge of their tiles on the board.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a tile is played, the edges of tiles which touch are compared.
			If a spear is adjacent to a blank edge, the tile with the blank edge is removed.
			If a spear is adjacent to a spear, count up the number of shields facing each tile-
			The tile surrounded by fewer shields is removed, or both are removed on a tie.
			If a tile is played and survives this process, tiles may not be played on any of the 8
			surrounding spaces on the next player's turn.
